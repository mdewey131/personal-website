Hi, I'm Michael. I'm a freelance data analyst and tutor located in Los Angeles. 
Welcome to my website! Here, you'll find updates from personal projects, 
including my contributions to [https://github.com/mdewey131/snappa-scoreboard](
Snappa Scoreboard), as well as other objects of interest. In time, I hope to have a
sizeable archive of statistics lectures that I deliver during tutoring, some practical
examples of modeling that I've carried out, and various coding projects (like Tidy
Tuesdays).

This website is made in `blogdown`, a fantastic package in R which allows users
to make static websites via Hugo.
