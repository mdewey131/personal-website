<p>Thanks for visiting my site! I’m a freelancer, currently open to full-time work,
based in Los Angeles. I’m originally from Santa Clarita, California, where I lived for the entirety of my childhood.
I am the proud recipient of a Master’s in Economics and Social Sciences from Bocconi University,
and two Bachelor’s degrees (one in Economics, and a second in Philosophy) from Loyola Marymount University.
Within Economics, I have mostly focused on Political Economy and Statistics. My Master’s Thesis
explored the role that the internet played in U.S. political polarization between
1996 and 2012, demonstrating heterogeneous treatment effect sizes in different population
subgroups through causal forest machine learning. The curious reader can find a copy
of that work <a href="/pdf/Thesis.pdf">here</a>, and a copy of my resume <a href="/pdf/Resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since defending my thesis in April of 2020, I have
been keeping busy by balancing freelancing and personal projects while looking
for steady employment. You can find a link to my GitHub page in the sidebar, where
I am currently working on a Shiny app with my friend Mark Barrett. That application tracks
performance in a game known as <a href="https://github.com/mdewey131/Snappa-Scoreboard/wiki/An-Overview-of-SnappaMetrics#what-is-snappa">Snappa</a>. Although the game itself is quite non-serious (and exclusively a weekend activity), the project itself has been an enjoyable source
of personal growth in coding and data analysis. In the future, I’ll be making
write-ups of some of the features that I’ve implemented and the results that I’ve found.
My post speed has slowed down as of late while I work on developing my Python skills for
future projects.</p>
<p>If you would like to get in contact with me, feel free to reach out. My email and other social
links are listed in the sidebar, and I’d love to hear from you.</p>
